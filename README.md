# AGH repository

Welcome to Poland's Local-Scale Evapotranspiration Data!<br>
Built-in the AGH University of Science and Technology of Kraków<br>

<h3>Main idea</h3>

The integration of remote sensing images of evapotranspiration in Poland through the GitHub repository offers two comparative advantages over other portals and models with evapotranspiration information. Firstly, evapotranspiration data are downloaded from the EUMETSAT (2024) with a daily temporal resolution, making it the web portal that offers the highest temporal resolution worldwide for free download of evapotranspiration images. Secondly, the EUMETSAT data model facilitates easy access and downloading of information using web scraping tools by automating tasks in Python using Anaconda virtual environments. These evapotranspiration data for Poland, available in the repository, serve as the first web portal for downloading specialized information for the country, thus becoming a crucial input for the estimation of runoff and prevention of natural disasters, leveraging the temporal and spatial resolution provided.<br>

The construction of the repository involved the creation of tools for the automatic extraction of data necessary for evapotranspiration analyses worldwide. In addition to evapotranspiration data, other data necessary for analyses of water run-off and water management locally were collected for Poland only. These included data on water precipitation, land infiltration and land use (EUMETSAT 2024; Czernecki et al. 2020; PGI-NRI 2024; Bergeson et al. 2022; Bi et al. 2014; Regüés et al. 2017; Hidayati et al. 2021; d'Obyrn 2012). Data integration in the repository, specific to Poland was developed in Anaconda (Mendez et al. 2019; Rolon-Mérette et al. 2020; Zampetti et al. 2021). It employs CI/CD pipelines to enhance code updates and versioning under its lifecycle through GitHub tools (Ramasamy et al. 2023; Wu et al. 2024; Oliveira et al. 2023; Wessel et al. 2023). Thereby establishing it as an indispensable and exclusive tool for accessing environmental data in Poland (the referenced repository focuses on a region north of the city of Lubin). It provides users with the capability to reparameterize the data according to their specific needs, such as defined areas in the country, temporal windows, spatial resolutions, among others, using built-in functions available in the repository.
